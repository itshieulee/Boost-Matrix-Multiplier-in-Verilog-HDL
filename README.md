# Booth-Matrix-Multiplier-in-Verilog-HDL
This project explores and compares two popular  signed multiplier architectures—Baugh-Wooley and Booth multipliers—through  the implementation of a 4×4 matrix multiplier in Verilog HDL. 

This project will be update to be able to run on Linux as FPGA SoC Hardware and System Design Project.
I'll soon update all works of this project. Stay tuned.
